                        <p>I'm a computer science student in the University of Girona (UdG), interested in programming and artificial intelligence.</p>
                        <p>I also like doing creative work like drawing. I enjoy playing videogames and "attempting" to create ones by myself.</p>
                        <p>When I finish studying, I'd like to work on a big project, designing software or creating videogames.</p>

                        <p>
                            Graduated in scientific-technologic baccalaureate in <a href = "https://agora.xtec.cat/insvescomtatdecabrera/"> Institut Vescomtat de Cabrera</a> (2018-2020), obtaining the C1 level in Catalan and Spanish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently I'm in the third year of computer science at Polytechnical Superior School in the University of Girona.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I went to painting and drawing classes for 8 years (2009-2017).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On my own I've learned some graphical libraries for c++.

                            I've worked full working day as an electrician assistant during the last three summers (2020-2022) at <a href = "https://www.renolit.com/es/">Renolit</a>
                            , doing electric maintenance such as installing motors, electrical panels, inspecting electric motors and other type of reparations to electric machinery.

                        <h3>Projects I've worked on</h3>
                        <p>I've worked in a few projects on my own, most of them are games made with c++ and a very interesting library called <a href = "https://www.raylib.com/">Raylib</a></p>
                        
                        <h4>Snake</h4>
                        <p>Done with c++ and a very useful library called Raylib I've recreated the classic game Snake.
                            Following good software design praxis. The game has been done from scratch and no game engines used, just c++ code and some calls to draw objects that Raylib provides. 
                            The game uses the object-oriented programming that c++ offers.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Pong</h4>
                        <p>Also done with c++ and Raylib, the game doesn't use object orientation, but provides well done local multiplayer that can be played with a controller or keyboard.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Minecraft script</h4>
                        <p>I've also done a script for one of the most popular game Minecraft.
                            The script is done with Java and inputs certain to the keyboard and mouse, based on what the script sees on screen.
                            The main use is to farm resources automatically without player interaction.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Scripting</h3>
                        <p>I've done various scripts most of them are focused on automating the input of a program and storing the outputs to later study the generated data.</p>
