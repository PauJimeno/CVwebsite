The targeted user profiles are enterprises that may want to contracat a computer scientist.

I've split-up the page in two rows, the left one has the most basic information about me, so if someone is reviewing my CV it won't need to search or read everything to know me.
In the right side is the most detailed information, so if the person looking at it is interested can proceed to read the rest of my cv.
The right-side column has the information sorted from most interesting to less, so studies on top and projects I’ve worked on my own last.
The lists that have hyperlinks on them have a little animation to let the user know that the item is interactable.

Finally, I decided to make more like a dark theme so people reading on low bright or in a dark room can read it nicely. I've also added a colour to each division so it's clear where an information ends and another one starts, the inner ‘divs’ have some transparent colour so the general overlook is not boring.
